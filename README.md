# Melanoma_Detection_Assignment
Developed as part of the Convolutional Neural Network Module required for Post Graduate Diploma in Machine Learning and AI - IIIT,Bangalore.


# Project Name
> This Project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- What is the background of your project? -  It is based out on a case study for understanding convolutional neural network concepts and implement it practically.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? - We are trying to build a model which can accurately detect melanoma ( A type of cancer that can be deadly )
- What is the dataset that is being used? - We are using dataset formed by International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases.


## Conclusions
- We were able to achieve an accuracy of roughly around 87% and see no sign of underfitting or overfitting.


## Technologies Used
- Python Language
- Various Python Libraries - Pandas, Numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, etc.
- Google Colab - Editor


## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by all the teachings and assignment as part of AI/ML course by IIITB and Upgrad.
